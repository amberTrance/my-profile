                <p>
                    My name is Angela but I prefer Angie :). I have built this webpage in vanilla JavaScript, 
                    HTML and CSS. I am currently learning how to code and studying german.
                    I like many different things and I've explored various fields throughout my life:
                 </p>

            <div class="hobbies">
                <div class="hobbies-btn">
                    <button onClick="showHobby('art')">Art</button>
                    <button onClick="showHobby('psy')">Psychology</button>
                    <button onClick="showHobby('science')">Science</button>
                    <button onClick="showHobby('code')">Coding</button>
                </div>
                <div class="hobbies-text">
                    <p id="art">
                        I've attended a school with an art profile throughout middle and high school.
                        I love classical art, beautiful colours and painting. But I love other forms 
                        of art as well. During the same period, I've shortly attended a theatre course
                        and vocal training. I've also had a short phase in which I wrote poetry.
                    </p>
                    <p id="psy" class="hide">
                        At the end of highschool I've realized that I want to have a job
                        that is intellectually stimulating. Philosophy was interesting to me, but 
                        I wanted something that is also applied. This is how I chose psychology.
                        Studying the human mind remains for me one of the most interesting and challenging
                        topics. However, I was not pleased with the current experimental approach and decided
                        to leave the field.
                    </p>
                    <p id="science" class="hide">
                        If we leave the ethical aspects aside, scientific thinking and its discoveries 
                        are, in my opinion, the most beautiful achievements of humanity. 
                        I find it fascinating, for instance,
                        that astronomers can tell the composition of distant stars and planets from the light 
                        wavelength received from those bodies. Or how a geologist can tell that a skeleton 
                        dates from these many million years ago because of the ground layer in which it finds
                        itself. This is why I love watching various documentaries, and among my favourite are
                        those of modern physics.
                    </p>
                    <p id="code" class="hide">
                        Coding contains in it many of the things I love. It always starts with a problem
                        "How do I make this?". And to answer, you need to think creatively, logically, and
                         also, to figure out the best implementation. Furthermore, you can perpetually learn new things, be 
                         surprised by what you can do, and take delight in getting better and better. This is
                         how I came to conclude that being a software developer is probably the best job for me.
                         In contrast, a neuroscientist career, which is what I have considered before, is 
                         perhaps 5% creative thinking, 45% reading other people's work, and the other 50% is a
                         mixture of repetitive lab work, writing technical papers and pleading for funding, among
                         other things. So, coding it is!! :D
