            <h2>A bit about me:</h2>
            <p>My name is Angela but I prefer Angie :)</p>
            <p>I am curious about many things and I've explored different fields throughout my life.</p>

                I've attended a school with an art profile throughout middle and high school.
                I love classical art, beautiful colours and painting. But I love other forms 
                of art as well. During the same period I've shortly attended a theater course
                and vocal training. I've also had a short phase in which I wrote poetry. So it
                may sound like my inclination is towards humanities, but my interest for scientific
                fields competes with my artistic inclination quite a bit.

            <p id="psy" class="hide">
                I have an analytical, logical type of thinking, and this prompted me to choose a 
                field in which I can use this in a creative way. This is how I chose psychology,
                since trying to figure out how minds work, seems to be as challenging intellectually,
                as it is creative. During the first year, the subjects I loved the most were
                neuroscience and behavioural genetics. But after doing lab research in these fields,
                I found out that unfortunatelly, neuroscience is quite limited in explaining how
                humans think, and so is genetic research.

                Science is awesome! I take pleasure in watching astronomy 
                (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1832668/">
                How the Universe Works</a> ) and physics documentaries 
                ( <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8060080/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">The Fabric of Cosmos</a> ). 
                I am particularly interested in modern physics, and around the end of 2020, 
                I got hooked on trying to understand quantum mechanics, particularly the double 
                slit experiment.

                When I had studied Matlab as a course in my Psychology degree, I already knew a bit
                of JavaScript probably from watching some online lecture. I've realized Matlab is not
                a pretty language, particularly if you're trying to draw a picture with it, which
                was what we had at some point in our course. That was weird, considering that Matlab
                was created for data analysis. Anyway, I still enjoyed building functions and solving
                problems. And when I've lost interest for lab research, I begun to study JavaScript,
                CSS and HTML on my own.
